# Publishing your adapter

{% hint style="info" %}
Automated publishing is in development. [Track progress here](https://github.com/TheAdaptiveWeb/AdaptiveWeb-CLI/issues/6) and submit adapter publishing requests directly by [creating an issue on TheAdaptiveWeb/adapter-registry](https://github.com/TheAdaptiveWeb/adapter-registry/issues).
{% endhint %}

### Submit your adapter for approval

Before submitting your adapter, make sure you have read and accept the [Adapter Publishing Terms](../contributing/adapter-publishing-terms.md) and [Code of Conduct](../contributing/code-of-conduct.md). Failure to comply with these terms may result in your adapter being rejected or removed for the platform.

Once you have completed development on your adapter, run `awcli publish` . Make sure you have tested your adapter before publishing, and that your source code is published and open-sourced under the Mozilla Public License 2.0. For more information on licensing, [please refer to this FAQ](../misc/frequently-asked-questions-faqs.md#do-my-adapters-have-to-be-licensed-under-a-specific-license).
