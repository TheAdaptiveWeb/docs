# Adapter Publishing Terms

## Changelog

_Version 1.0 - Initial_

## Preface

The purpose of this page is to set out the terms associated with publishing an adapter.

## Ownership

You may maintain the adapter on your own repository and continue development. We encourage you to engage with the community and accept contributions from others.

In the event that you no longer wish to maintain your adapter, you may wish donate your adapter to be hosted under the Adaptive Web GitHub organisation to allow for its development to continue. If you wish to do this, [please open an issue](https://github.com/TheAdaptiveWeb/AdaptiveWeb.io/issues).

## License

Your adapter must be licensed under the [Mozilla Public License 2.0 \(MPL 2.0\)](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/MPL/2.0/). 

## Code of Conduct

By publishing your adapter, you agree to our [Code of Conduct](code-of-conduct.md) \(CoC\). Enforcement of this CoC includes activity on your own repository. If you are found in breach of the CoC, your name will be removed as a contributor and your adapter may be removed or forked under the Adaptive Web GitHub organisation \(see [ownership](adapter-publishing-terms.md#ownership)\).

## Termination

In the event that you are found to be in breach of these terms, or in the event that you delete or close-source your adapter, your adapter may be on-boarded to the Adaptive Web to allow for continued development and maintenance.

By publishing your adapter, you agree that the Adaptive Web has the right to use published code in any and all future adapters, including republishing your work under our GitHub organisation.
