# Contributing as an Organisation

_The Adaptive Web_ is an open-source platform which aims to adapt webpages to increase web accessibility. It provides innovations and enhancements to the browsing experience of users with sensory impairments **at no cost**.

We're looking for partners who can help us to provide these innovations to people who need them. We are particularly interested in seeking support from charities and organisations associated with the provision of assistive technologies. If you think you could help, we'd love to hear from you; please get in touch at [opensource@adaptiveweb.io](mailto:opensource@adaptiveweb.io). Read on to discover what the Adaptive Web can achieve.
