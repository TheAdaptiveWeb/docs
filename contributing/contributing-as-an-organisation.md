# Contributing as an Organisation

_The Adaptive Web_ is an open-source platform which aims to adapt webpages to increase web accessibility. It provides innovations and enhancements to the browsing experience of users with sensory impairments **at no cost**.

We're looking for partners who can help us to provide these innovations to people who need them. We are particularly interested in seeking support from charities and organisations associated with the provision of assistive technologies. If you think you could help, we'd love to hear from you; please get in touch at [opensource@adaptiveweb.io](mailto:opensource@adaptiveweb.io). Read on to discover what the Adaptive Web can achieve.

## What the platform can do

Thanks to our open-source contributors, the Adaptive Web is getting better every day. Below are some examples of what the community has built so far:

#### Adaptive Contrast ratios

For sites that contain page elements that do not conform to the [Web Content Accessibility Guidelines 2.1 \(WCAG 2.1\)](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/), the Adaptive Web can find and fix these problems:

#### Video Audio Description

For visually impaired users, the Adaptive Web can provide audio description of web videos based on Deep Learning models:

#### Image Alt Tag Generation

The Adaptive Web can generate alt-tags from images that do not have any.

#### Personalisation

All of these features are highly customisable and fine-tuneable to suit users individual needs.

## How you can help

We are looking for enthusiastic partners to get this technology into the hands of the people who need it.

 Access to information and services on the web is becoming a hugely important aspect of modern life. Inaccessible sites may occur for a variety of reasons such as the site no longer being actively maintained, low development budgets and/or timeframes, or lack of knowledge regarding accessibility. While there has been, and should be greater focus on the importance of developers conforming to web accessibility standards, a new solution is needed to make sure information is universally accessible.

If you think you can help us in our mission to make the web more accessible, please get in touch at [opensource@adaptiveweb.io](mailto:opensource@adaptiveweb.io)
