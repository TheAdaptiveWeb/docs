# Configuring Adapters

## Installing adapters

Once you have [installed the Adaptive Web](installing-the-adaptive-web.md), you can proceed to install adapters.

Click the browser toolbar icon at the top right of your browser, or navigate to [https://adaptiveweb.io/configure](https://adaptiveweb.io/configure):

Select an adapter you want to install from the list of available adapters. This will open a dialog which shows a description of the adapter you want to install.

To enable the adapter, click the "Enable" button.

You will now see configurable settings for that adapter. These settings are different from adapter to adapter and allow for a high degree of personalisation. Change the settings to suit your needs, and you can proceed to go and test your adapter.
